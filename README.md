# Sales Engine

This is a project I did together with [David Shim](https://github.com/dsshim) at the end
of our first module at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io).
The purpose of this project is to write a data reporting tool that manipulates and reports on merchant transactional data.

###Project Goals

* Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
* Build a complex system of relationships using multiple interacting classes
* Demonstrate the DRY principle with modules and/or duck typing
* Separate parsing and data loading logic from business logic
* Use memoization to improve performance

The most challenging part of this project was to understand how the different components
are connected and how to use their attributes in a way that allows for consice, dry code.
